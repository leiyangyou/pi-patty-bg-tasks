        //    not "stop the model": interactive-mode's abortHandler drains
        //    steering+followUp back into the editor *unsent* and only then aborts
        //    the run. Text injected after that drain lands in a run that is already
        //    dying, and agent-loop returns at its error/aborted branch without ever
        //    reaching the follow-up drain.
        // 2. A follow-up is only drained once a turn produces NO tool calls
        //    (agent-loop.js follow-up drain, outside the tool loop). "Delivered
        //    after the current turn settles" therefore means "after the whole
        //    tool-chaining run settles" — measured at 42 turns / 5m29s in one real
        //    session. A steer is drained at the next turn boundary instead.
        //
        // The backgrounding above already makes the bash tool return
        // "Process backgrounded as job-N" inside the same turn, which is what ends
        // the turn, so that boundary arrives immediately.
